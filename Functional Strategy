ðŸ§© Functional Breakdown Strategy:
Step	Question to Ask	Java 8 Concept
1	What is my input?	    :   A string of words
2	Can I break it into a stream of elements?   :   	Yes â†’ Stream.of(input.split(" "))
3	What transformation or filtering is needed?     :   	Find max based on length â†’ Comparator.comparingInt(String::length)
4	What result do I want?      :   	A single string (word) â†’ .max(...)
5	What if input is empty?     :	Handle with .orElse("")


ðŸ§  In Functional Mindset, You Think:
"What is the data?" â†’ Words

"What is the operation?" â†’ Find max by length

"How to express that as a pipeline?" â†’ Stream â†’ Max â†’ Output


ðŸ”¥ How to Practice Thinking Functionally:
Task	Ask Yourself
Filtering? :	Use .filter()
Transforming? :	Use .map()
Aggregating? :	Use .reduce() or .collect()
Sorting or Picking Max?	 : Use .sorted(), .min(), .max()
Grouping? :	Use Collectors.groupingBy()
Joining? :	Use Collectors.joining()
Counting? :	Use .count() or Collectors.counting()
